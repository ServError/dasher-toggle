# Dasher-Toggle

Dasher-Toggle is a very simple adaptation of Dasher designed to toggle between two actions.
This is simply a state that changes on each button press dictating that the next state will act differently.
For setup instructions, see the original dasher. The example in this fork includes an updated secondary action field.
