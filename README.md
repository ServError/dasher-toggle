# Dasher-Toggle

Dasher-Toggle is a very simple adaptation of Dasher designed to toggle between multiple actions for HTTP POST type requests.
This is simply a state that changes on each button press dictating that the next state will act differently.
For setup instructions, see the original dasher. The example in this fork includes an updated secondary and tertiary action field.
The toggle should adjust automatically to cycle through the number of actions you've specified in the config.

Inspiration for this fork is the limitations of Wink shortcuts and their integration into IFTTT.
